 * be activated via command line switches. Note that activating both IPv4 and
 * IPv6 is pointless (and will not work because two UDP and two TCP threads
 * will be started that concur for ports). Because of that, it is not allowed.
 * When pdnsd runs with IPv6 activated it should be able to service queries
 * from IPv6 as well as from IPv4 hosts, provided that you host is configured
 * properly.
 * For each of the protocols there are two options: ENABLE_IPV4 and ENABLE_IPV6
 * control whether support for the respective protocol is available in the 
 * binary. DEFAULT_IPV4 selects which protocol is enabled on pdnsd
 * startup by default. 1 means IPv4, while 0 means IPv6. If support for
 * a protocol was included in the executable, you can specify command line
 * parameters to activate or deactivate that protocol (the options are -4 and 
 * -6), but it makes more sense to use the run_ipv4=on/off option in the
 * configuration file.
